# Markov Decision Process: Iterative Algorithms comparative-based implementation

In this project we will try to set a very basic environment in order to make a statistical comparaison between thre main algorithms used in Markov descision processes: Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Gauss Siedel Value Iteration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Java Develepoment Kit (JDK)
On Linux
```
  sudo [your-package-manager] update -y
  sudo [your-package-manager] install open-jdk -y
```
On MacOSx:
```
  brew install open-jdk
```

### Installing
the project contains a Makefile, once you invoke it, it will compile the whole project and run the program for you. you just need to call it by:
```
  make 
```
after making the project, a windown interface will popup if nothing goes wrong during compilation, the window looks like the figure below.
